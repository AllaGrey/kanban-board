# Task Management Boards

## Project Description

Task Management Boards is a web application for managing tasks, allowing users to create, update, and delete boards with tasks. Each board contains three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Users can add, update, and delete task cards within each column. Additionally, users have the ability to move cards between columns and change their order.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (using only hooks), Redux Toolkit for state management.
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript.
- Database: MongoDB.
- Testing: No testing is implemented at this stage. Testing algorithms will be developed later.

## Requirements

- Each visitor can create/update/delete boards.
- Each board contains three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- Each visitor can enter a board ID and load relevant columns with cards (if any exist).
- Each visitor can add/update/delete cards (with a title and description).
- Users can move cards between columns and change their order.
- User authentication is not required. Board management is considered anonymous.
